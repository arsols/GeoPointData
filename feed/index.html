				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re a real estate professional on a budget. You’re concerned about where your next check is going to come from. You need to do some marketing. Where do you start? It’s actually easier than you may think… </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself,</span><b><i> what are you willing to give up? Money or Time? </i></b></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter which you choose. They work together or individually. If you have both money and time, with a bit of direction, you can do some serious damage in this new market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way for local investors &amp; Realtors to compete with national real estate disruptors is to focus messaging on a very specific set of homeowner problems that apply to a narrow subsection of homeowners. This allows you to increase the effectiveness of your messaging &amp; decrease your spend. Win &#8211; Win, for your business &amp; family. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the real estate pros with the deepest pockets struggle with the most effective way to get their marketing message or better stated “offer” in front of a homeowner’s eyes and/or ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, it’s not complicated.

				<p><strong>Traffic X Conversions = Qualified Leads&#8230; AKA MONEY! </strong></p><p>Let’s break this equation down:</p><p><strong>Traffic = Number of “at bats” with homeowners seeing or listening to your offer</strong></p><ul><li>When a customer sees your offer, your brand has had a “transaction” with a customer. We call that traffic. Greg’s traffic focus is pay per click, but traffic to a homeowner may originate as an outbound text message, call, voicemail, postcards, letters, facebook ads, custom social media audience uploads and/or door knockers.</li></ul><p><strong>Conversions = Favorable customer response</strong></p><ul><li>When a customer interacts favorably with your offering, no matter how minimal the interaction is &#8211; you have a conversion. An interaction may be minimal as a click on a Facebook ad&#8217;s landing page or a favorable response to a text message. You must continually tweak your marketing to increase prospect conversions.</li></ul><p><strong>Leads = Willing to sell house under the right circumstances </strong></p><ul><li>A prospect is not a lead. When a customer gives you any indication they would consider selling their home, you have a qualified lead. Even if the lead says I will only sell when my son graduates highschool in 2 years &#8211; BOOM. CONGRATS. You have a LEAD. A crap lead, but a lead none-the-less. Now follow up 36 times until they sell the house, ideally with you!</li></ul><h3><strong>What is a vacant property list?</strong></h3><p>Some gurus use technical terms to describe their super duper special, completely different from everyone else’s vacant property list. They don’t have an algorithm to create the vacant lead.</p><p>They don’t use google maps to verify and they don’t have access to utility shut-offs unless they are breaking the law, <span style="font-weight: 400;">or have some ninja software we would </span><b><i>love</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hear about. </span></p><p>Use of data for an unintended purpose is illegal, <span style="font-weight: 400;">and we’re not aware of data sources that can be scraped.</span> They aren’t breaking the law &#8211; they are <span style="font-weight: 400;">using a marketing trick called hype</span>. </p><p>A vacant home is a property deemed by the USPS as vacant &#8211; that sounds super simple, but it’s a pain in the ass to accomplish. The USPS charges some $280K +/- for access to the API. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few companies have it, but o</span>nce you have access to the API, you have to own all the buy / sell property data in order to ping off the USPS records to determine whether the property is vacant or occupied.</p><p>The USPS maintains this list for massive marketing companies. Even today, there are many companies that produce &amp; send thick magazine quality advertisements through the mail. Those are very very expensive.</p>					</div>

				<h3><strong>Are you old enough to remember JC Penny’s catalogs delivered to your home!?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were born around the early 80’s ages living in a middle class home in Middle America, you would remember the JC Penney’s catalogs They were over 2” thick. Most young boys were first exposed to images of (kinda) scantily clad women in old school undies via the JC Penney catalog. If our reader has no idea what us old folks are talking about &#8211; I&#8217;ll give you a hint&#8230; </span></p><h3><strong>Victoria&#8217;s Secret didn’t exist and the internet was yet to be what it is.</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, a bunch of big companies back in the day banned together to lobby our government to force the postal delivery officer to write down when mail starts to stack up in a homeowners mailbox. If it stacks long enough &amp; is noticed by the postal employee &#8211; BOOM&#8230; Vacant lead. </span></p><h3><strong>Restoration Hardware &amp; others still send these super expensive catalogs to households &#8211; they don’t pay to send them to vacant homes.</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, a few smart people (</span><a href="https://kentclothier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">think Kent Clothier, REWW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) figured out this nifty little trick to reverse engineer the postal service’s service tracking of vacant homes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reverse engineering this feed for an alternative purpose was brilliant. So brilliant in fact, our company set up similar software to do the same thing &#8211; in 2016. Although it’s old technology&#8230; it still works. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are very few companies that maintain the vacancies with 100% coverage, let alone stacking the data with owner’s age, syndicated credit scores, seniors with two stories, empty nesters or kids living at home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data does all those &amp; more.</span></p><h3><strong>Run a count for your traditional owner occupant or absentee data with your other usual filters. . Then try stacking absentee &amp; vacant homes without phone numbers in your major metropolitan area. . Isn’t that super cool? </strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How many homes are there in your  metro that are absentee, have high equity &amp; owner is over the age of 60 years old? That’s a good one, no? </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><strong>How to stack your data to create a prospect list of homeowners that may have recently passed with your vacant home leads.</strong></h3><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single family, condos or multiplexes in your geography</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchased prior to 2015</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owner age 65+</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vacant</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Equity </span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that most data companies don’t have a way to easily deliver a small number of vacant houses reasonable price is because you have to send all the homes in any metro area into the USPS system in order to figure out whether or not they are vacant. Third party companies upcharge that expense. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, if you want the vacant homes for Baltimore, you have to own all the property data in Baltimore to ping the list to figure out which are vacant. It’s sucks, it’s a lot of work &amp; costs real money but the result is exactly what investors, Realtors &amp; wholesalers are looking for in homeowners &#8211; motivation.  </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><strong>We ping the entire homeowner database against the USPS system on a monthly basis to generate our vacant home lists.</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not just a real estate data company, we are an actual data aggregator. We warehouse every buy sell transaction across the United States. We maintain many massive homeowner, consumer demographic, cell phone, landlines &amp; email addresses. databases that update daily, monthly &amp; quarterly.Our customers now have access to data that hasn’t existed in our industry.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a data aggregator,we purchase, warehouse &amp; scale without comparison to our competitors. We spend an amazing amount of money on this data, because we sell data to over 47 different types of businesses. We have better pricing &amp; can beat anyone’s pricing.. </span></p><h3><strong>Why use vacant homes as a real estate lead list?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is such an easy question to answer. A vacant house is a dead asset. A dead asset doesn’t have any productive financial value &amp; even worse, in the case of a residential home &#8211; there are SIGNIFICANT expenses to maintain the unproductive property. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dead asset that costs money creates motivation. A motivated seller is more likely to sell a property. A motivated seller more likely to sell a property is a prospect that is more likely to listen to your offering. A motivated homeowner interested in your offer will likely sell their home to somebody, may as well be with you! </span></p><h3><strong>Unless your asset is stock, gold, silver or platinum, the maintenance of a asset carries significant expenses. </strong></h3>					</div>

				<h3><strong>Why are vacant homes so valuable? </strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is simple, in Great Recession of 2008, the residential housing crash basically created a financial vehicle never before recognized as a financial model that could be run from an office in Wall Street or Silicon Valley. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big money has traditionally only been in the real estate industry through scaled commercial &amp; multifamily assets because it was determined long ago that financial efficiencies in scaled assets like big apartment complexes. We have since proven that simply  is not true. </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><strong>Want to know why Wall Street &amp; Silicon Valley like residential homes as their new asset class? </strong></h3><h3> </h3><h3><strong><i>Because it’s a productive asset that will always hold an inherent &amp; utilitarian value.</i></strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does that mean? Let me give you an example, gold is an asset that will always hold some inherent value &#8211; but is it a productive asset? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, gold inherently is the most emotional asset available. It has zero utilitarian value, unless you want to impress your friends when you bring them into your personal gold vault. It’s only value is in the eyes of the market. What is that fleck of gold is worth relative to the supply &amp; demand for gold at that moment in time. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A productive asset has the ability to produce income above the asset value itself, therefore a productive residential asset is an occupied or rented home. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guess what!</span></p><h3><strong>All real estate professionals including Wall Street &amp; Silicon Valley hate unproductive assets &#8211; also known as vacant houses.</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners hate them too, they cost A LOT of money. Mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance &#8211; all these bills have to be paid whether there is someone living in the house or not. </span></p><h3><strong>Simply put&#8230;Homeowners should sell vacant homes.</strong></h3>					</div>

				<h3><strong>How to use a vacant homes list?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate investors &amp; wholesalers LOVE vacant houses &#8211; because it’s a dead (unproductive) asset. It currently holds zero utilitarian value for the owner &amp; therefore the owner is highly likely to sell the house fast and is more likely to leave money on the table when selling. The dead asset is actually a financial burden that the homeowner wants to be rid of as fast as possible. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re using our vacant lead lists for postcards, handwritten letters or door knocking this detail will save you a HUGE amount of money. If you are using this data for cell phone, landline or text messaging &#8211; this is the best data available for inexpensively reaching out to homeowners. </span></p><h3><strong>Why work with Geopoint Data?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data updates it’s buy-sell ownership &amp; vacancy matching database weekly and it’s national vacant home list monthly. Don’t buy cheap old data from other software providers &#8211; we have the best data available, lists custom built for you. </span></p><h3><strong>This is our business &amp; we stand behind our work.</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know which homes in your county are vacant? Geopoint Data has it. Want to know which vacant homes have been owned for 30 years, the owner is above the age of 65 and has high equity? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know which homes are occupied &amp; owned by someone over the age of 65 with two or more stories??? We’ve got that. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know what homes in your city are vacant, have high equity &amp; credit? Geopoint Data has you covered. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know which vacant houses are absentee owners? We’ve got that. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know which houses in your area are vacant that also have a reported felony,  misdemeanor, property liens, city violations, court ordered judgments, personal bankruptcy and/or evictions. It’s a HUGE amount of work, but we do that! </span></p><h3><strong>Did we make our point?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vacant property data can be used for mailers, text messaging, ringless voicemails, outbound calling, Facebook custom audience targeting, door knocking &amp; so much more. Because we already own all the data, we are able to sell our data cheaper than our competitors. </span></p><h3><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/stacked-list-builder/"><strong>Prospect Less, Close More.

				<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&#8220;I was born and raised in Chicago, where I got the real estate bug early, at just 6 years old while painting the front porch of one of our rental homes. I re-discovered real estate as a freshman at Marquette University in Milwaukee while at an internship. I then transferred to the University of Illinois business school for a finance degree with a specialization in commercial real estate.&#8221; Dustin says.</span></p><div class="Ov(h) Trs($transition-readmore) Mah(999999px)" data-reactid="39"><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">In 2003, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dustindefrates/">Dustin</a> moved to Scottsdale, Arizona anticipating a residential market boom, he was right. He flipped hundreds of houses and to date has built 77 apartments, condos and single family homes. He also predicted the market crash back in 2006, and was able to drop out and pull all his partner&#8217;s capital from the market prior to the Great Recession.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">&#8220;I became a licensed realtor in 2008 and ended up negotiating over 140 short sales saving homeowners from foreclosure. Between 2010 and 2012, I bought 100 of the best home value add opportunities in all of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, and with the help of his brother, I was able to remodel them all.&#8221; Dustin recalls.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">Today, Dustin runs <a href="http://defratesgroup.com/">The Defrates Group</a>, a managing equity partner in five family office portfolios with a market valuation of 17MM, and is on a mission to own a one-thousand eight hundred through rolling his portfolio and bringing on new and exciting partnerships. After stabilizing a brokerage, his construction and property management services and his unique approach to reverse 1031 exchanges in rolling value add residential assets, DeFrates co-founded Geopoint Data and The Call Gurus.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">Geopoint Data is one of the leading homeowner data aggregators out there. They warehouse the purchase and sale records of over a hundred million residential homes across the US, as well as over 380 million cell phones, landlines and email addresses. With this information, they are able to tell whether a property is vacant or occupied. They also know the property&#8217;s characteristics and sale information, along with a rich array of demographics on the homeowner including: age, kids&#8217; age, income, net worth, empty nesters, senior in household, senior with two stories, syndicated consumer credit score and much more.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">&#8220;We stack that data on top of itself to help narrow a target audience of homeowners most likely to sell their home. We also append over 170 traits related to homeowners across the US, especially relating to the three D&#8217;s: Death, Divorce &amp; Dissolution, upward or downward trajectory in life circumstance (and so many more) to determine which homeowners across the US are likely associated with physical, financial or familial distress.&#8221; Dustin explains.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">Using national data systems, algorithms, omni-channel communication system and a contact center in the Silicon Valley of Mexico (Guadalajara), Dustin and his team have the unique ability to uncover off-market opportunities across the US utilizing the specialized services of Geopoint Data.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">On the other hand, The Call Gurus provide specialized lead generation, qualification &amp; customer management services, enhancing our client&#8217;s sales cycle by maintaining interactions with their customers as our client focuses on growth in their personal lives and scale in their business.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">With all of this, Dustin has revolutionized the way local real estate business is done&#8211;by being able to assist his clients by providing their customers with scaled operational services that many so-called big-dollar Wall Street &#8220;real estate disruptors&#8221; use to attempt control of local real estate markets. Dustin is looking to bring operational infrastructure to local real estate investors &amp; Realtors by providing creative and innovative solutions.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">&#8220;Geopoint Data and The Call Gurus are the necessary evolution from local business practices. Local businesses have to use the same cutting edge data and communication technology all the national companies use. I decided it was time to prioritize the collection of homeowner data and put the very best communication tools in our real estate professional&#8217;s hands. I want to help people build-out a turnkey real estate business using the resources I used to grow my business.&#8221;</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="45">DeFrates states.

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if there was one thing which would guaranteed increase your conversions exponentially when done correctly?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Would you throw everything you have into this one thing to ensure your business thrives in any environment? </span></p><p> </p><p><b>Follow-up is the most important part of your business </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a quick look at your follow-up right now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How does it look? How many points of contact does each lead receive? What type of ad mediums / channels are you using to maintain your follow-up? Do you have a system you replicate on every lead or do you change your follow-up constantly trying new strategies, never giving it enough time to actually work?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself, how many leads have you talked to who ended up selling their home to someone else, maybe someone who offered less than what you offered, simply because they followed up more? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money have you knowingly or unknowingly left on the table by not following up like your business depended on it?</span></p><p><b>The first rule about follow-up is there is never too much follow-up.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let me say that again, the first rule of follow-up is there in NEVER too much follow-up. This is not even a rule&#8230; it is a law as true as gravity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means, if you have reason to believe this homeowner is going to sell their home&#8230; if someone hangs up on you, if someone slams a door on you, if someone yells at you, if someone tells you to never call again, in any situation good or bad what do you do…? Keep on following-up. If they hang up the phone, send a postcard. If they don’t respond, knock on the door. If they slam the door, send a handwritten note. If they don’t respond to the note, rinse &amp; repeat. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you have to lose from following-up?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maybe you are worried about a bad review? Maybe you are worried they will get mad? Maybe you feel like you are nagging them too much. All these things are distractions from the main point, and these feelings are only in your head &#8211; unmanifested. Most Americans that know how to create opportunity can figure out how to be a Realtor or wholesaler. </span></p><p><b>Want to know who makes it? The people who leave no lead left behind. </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are not special. There are LOTS of buyers, Realtors, investors, wholesalers, iBuyers, real estate disruptors. If a homeowner wants to sell their home, especially for cash, they will be able to find someone to sell in a google search or a quick skim through the mail drawer. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without follow-up, you will be forgotten. This is where follow-up comes in. You have an opportunity… more importantly an obligation, to remind a lead you are here with a home selling solution whenever they are ready to sell, if that ever happens. You are shifting the control of the situation to have the ball in your court instead of relying on a lead to think of your special mailer, voicemail or short conversation on the phone months after the fact when they are looking to sell their home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your job, as a real estate professional, to stay in the front of the minds of the leads you are contacting so when they want to explore their options, they will come to you because you are familiar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You may have been “annoying”, but you were still there. You educated them and by caring enough to check in every month regarding their situation, you, over time, become a trusted asset for the homeowner when they need the value you can bring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with follow-up is knowing what strategies to use to effectively stay in front of your leads mind in creative ways to keep the communication fresh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for you, through </span><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/?ref=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lead lists, you receive an immense amount of data associated with a homeowner as well as the property they own. Armed with this information, which includes cell phone numbers, landlines and emails you have more than enough ammunition to have a vast amount of follow-up with your leads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&#8217;s get into the trenches and create some fun ways to keep your pipeline full by following up with your leads like your business depends on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow-up is exactly what it suggests… follow-up. In order to follow-up you have to have an initial outreach. Let’s, for the sake of this article, start with a cold call being the first form of contact with a lead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cold call, gauge the interest of the lead from no interest, to highly interested. You can do the same thing via a webform or text message. No interest is still on the spectrum of interest and we will still follow-up with these leads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seperate the leads into these different interest buckets so you can follow-up accordingly based on their interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you are using </span><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/?ref=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as your lead list partner, we can expect you to have cell phones, landlines and emails for each lead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are on the phone with them, ask them for their best contact number and confirm their email. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a text to their confirmed number, or the number you called if they do not confirm, with your name and company and tell them to save it in their phone. Boom. First follow-up done and now you are in their phone. Most likely they did not save your number but now when you text them, the message will go into the past text conversation so they know who is texting them based on the message you sent. Consider this putting a door stopper on the lead, making sure the door is always open, even if just slightly cracked, for you to stop by &amp; say hello.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the call is done, send them a text thanking them for their time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do this with your entire lead list until you have all your interest buckets sorted with people who were interested, open to another conversation, slightly interested, and not interested so you can follow-up accordingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><b>Follow-up Strategies and Ideas</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send an email to all the leads thanking them for their time. Send them an email every week to check in. Send them articles on their market. Send them local comps or listings. Send them anything they would see as value. Use all of these as forms of continuing the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give them a call every week or two to check in to see how they are doing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ask them if they had time to look at some of the things you sent their email. Let them know if they need anything at all to reach out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a text thanking them for their time after every call. If they do not answer their phone, send them a text saying “sorry I missed you” and to try to set up a time to get them on the phone at a future date. Send these leads a postcard or mailer with your company information on it. Send them a handwritten letter. Send them holiday cards. Maybe even door knock their address to formally introduce yourself to them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give them a call telling them a postcard is on the way or a letter should be in the mail for them to look for. Call them wishing them a happy holiday. Call them wishing them a happy 4th of July. Call them wishing them a happy Spring or April or call them to wish them a happy Tuesday.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>People won’t hate that you’re trying, most appreciate your efforts. </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friend them on Facebook and like and comment on their posts. Turn on their post notifications so you can see when they post and you can be the first to like it. Look on social media and find their birth date so you can wish them a happy birthday.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn what they like &amp; share something funny or informative on their page. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give them a call about the thing you shared on their page or send them a text to check it out because they are going to love it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they tell you to stop following-up, slow down the follow-up on them but make sure to send them an email every couple months or when you do a mail campaign.  Still send them a text on holidays to wish their family well. Stay in the front of their minds. </span><b>You want to become synonymous with housing solutions so when the time comes they choose you or maybe even refer someone to you.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If they don’t like your offer, make sure you have another offer ready to go. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they continue to tell you to stop, keep following up, keep liking their posts, keep sending them mailers, keep wishing them well, keep reminding them you are here to help them if they need it. </span><b>They may not want to talk to you right now but maybe they will lose their job next month and really need your services. You need to make sure you are there when their mood shifts. </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they block your phone number, send them an email. If they block your email, send them a Facebook message. If they block you on Facebook, send them a letter. You always will have mail to fall back on… You know how many times people that were for months or years unwilling to talk to real estate professionals that eventually decided the time was right &amp; remembered the guy that followed up  as their first choice to discuss their options. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you’re the one in their mind when they are ready to move &#8211; you will be able to deliver your offer. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As children, we have been trained to avoid follow-up. “Billy, if Johnny doesn’t want to share, leave him alone”. That’s stupid. If you want to play with the toy next, there are a bunch of other kids that want to play with the toy. You HAVE to be there when Johnny is ready to give up that amazing toy!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been trained to consider this stalker type behavior. It’s not. No one actually thinks that… if anything, it’s only in your head. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times have changed. You have something a home seller wants, you have all the solutions they need but maybe they are just not ready yet. One day they will think of moving… their bills will be piling up and they need a way out, they will think about that “annoying realtor or wholesaler” and BAM a mailer will hit their doorstep… again. Followed by another email, a text and a random cold call wishing them the best on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Pancake Day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All proving you are committed and confident in your ability to give them the home solution they need.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How bad do you want their business? How much would that assignment fee help you? How mad would you be knowing you called them in March, did not follow-up as much as you knew you should have to later find out their home was listed in April by a real estate professional who called them at the “right time”.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>What is the worst thing that can happen from too much follow-up?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A complaint? A blocked number? A passive aggressive comment on your comment on their social media? An email being blocked? Some harsh words?</span></p><p> </p><p><b>What is the best thing that can happen from too much follow-up?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deal? A referral? A job well done? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people give up after the initial call and barely, if at all, follow-up. This means you can stand out from the crowd by not giving up on your leads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could see the future and know a deal will go through after following up every month for a year, why wouldn&#8217;t you follow-up? There is no way of knowing a deal will happen as a result of this type of follow-up but I guarantee the odds are higher than if you stop following-up or never start in the first place.</span></p>					</div>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skip tracing can be a complicated process. To make it more complicated there are hundreds of companies and thousands of freelancers who are trying to gain your business. Through all these factors there are a few words which mean the most when it comes to skip tracing; terms you need to understand.</span></p><p><b>Skip Trace Hit &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The “hits” on a skip traced list add into the most widely utilized marketing term for skip tracing, the infamous “hit rate.” A “Hit” in skip tracing is another word for a result. If you have a list of 1 address and through the skip tracing process contact information for this address is found, it is referred to as a hit. If no contact information is found, there is no hit. (Note: other words for a hit can be a “Match”)</span></p><p><b>Hit Rate &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A “Hit Rate” is the percentage or “Rate” of hits, results or matches your list comes back with after the skip trace is complete. If you submitted a list of 10,000 records and the hit rate was 70%, 7,000 records came back with results and 3,000 records came back with no results (blanks).</span></p><p><b>Skip Trace Search &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A “Search” is when a skip trace is run on your list. This is simply an attempt in finding the contact information on your submitted list.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>How This Affects You</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These terms come into play when you are choosing a skip trace company, mainly in how they are charging for their services.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>Being Charged For Searches</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies charge you for searches. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means if your list is 10,000 records you will be charged on the entire amount of searches on the list, 10,000 searches.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If they are charging $0.20 per record a search, you will have to pay $2,000 for the skip trace. Here is where the hit rate comes in. If the company has an average hit rate of 70% you are paying $2,000 for 10,000 searches and only getting back, on average, 7,000 hits. </span><b>In other words, 3,000 of the records you submitted and paid for come back with no contact information. Your effective skip trace “hit” rate is $0.29 per contact record. </b></p><p> </p><p><b>Being Charged For Hits</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some companies charge for searches, others charge for record hits, or records that come back with matched contact information. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means if you submit 10,000 records for a skip trace you are only paying for the records which come back with contact information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So now, using the same $0.20 as above, you are paying $2,000 for skip tracing a list of 10,000 records but with a hit rate of 70% only 7,000 records come back with contact information. </span><b>Since you are only charged for the hits, you would receive a refund for the non-hits, 3,000 records in this case, for a total of $600. Bringing your total cost for the skip trace to $1,400.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the difference between skip trace searches and hits can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars when it comes to your skip tracing needs. We hope you now can make an educated decision to choose which type of skip trace company you want to work with.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>Do you Even Need Skip Tracing In The First Place?</b></p><p><b><i>How much money would you save by not having to skip trace your lists?</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How much time would you save knowing you have a 100% complete, ready to go list when your order a list? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re able to skip trace a list with a company, shouldn’t they be able to provide you with the data? The holy grail in our industry is to have the property details, the homeowner names, addresses &amp; demographic information &amp; all the available cell phones, landlines &amp; email addresses. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company is currently changing the narrative in the real estate lead list industry by providing just that: 100% complete lead lists, ordered using the filtering you require. There is no need to  skip trace a list, again, ever.</span></p><p> </p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5854" src="https://www.geopointdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/geopoint_Logo-300x79.png" alt="" width="300" height="79" /></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/?ref=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a lead list company out of Scottsdale, Arizona and provides the only lists you will ever need as a realtor, wholesaler or real estate investor.

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using an email campaign, there are</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices you cannot afford to ignore</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common misconceptions using email for lead generation</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to avoid lasting problems for your business</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our two primary concerns are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to avoid spam filters</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to avoid bounce</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both work towards each other’s benefit. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to email lists, and more particularly, generating these email lists, the process causes accuracy issues. If you can imagine all the different places we gather our data from &#8211; basically everywhere… we only suggest using our email addresses if your a professional emailer. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide emails for our data lists always free of charge, to be used as a bonus method for email outreach. </span></p><p><b>We provide email addresses only as a courtesy. If you’re going to send email addresses in scale &#8211; you must “verify” email addresses. </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself how many email addresses you have created, or used to sign up for things on the internet. The reason there are accuracy issues with emails in particular, relates to how easy it is for someone to provide fake or old email addresses. Also, when it comes to signing up for email subscriptions, do you always use the same one? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of people have multiple emails for multiple purposes and the emails which are not readily used may be triggered in a scraping process, some may be inactive, leading to the Achilles heel of email marketing: a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bounce </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sending an email to an inactive email address). That being said, email campaigns, when done correctly, are a great way to get in front of a large audience in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><b>Here are some tips and tricks to avoid having your emails hit the spam folder and avoid your domain being blacklisted.</b></p><p><b>Avoid Bounces Like Your Email Depends On It</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to stack the odds in your favor when it comes to emails bouncing is to check your entire email list with an email verification software. Companies such as </span><a href="https://neverbounce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeverBounce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a great resource. Yes, having your list scrubbed for invalid emails does cost money but the cost is minimal and worth the health of your domain.  At the time this article was created, the pricing for never bounce is detailed below.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; background-color: transparent; font-size: 14.6667px; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OeypUs76hKjy3HvpYFfXyspRfYkpdA4_fpBL-Rb1AHsc6fRmBmBMSE3J6jz7VpsAhOSYR4WKTMQLzQdlS53xc-PshL5WzNPwY1uaqm3nWDUlRCqCsHp4_gh1e2n2Niclp4DpvUQB" width="503" height="342" /></p>					</div>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By not using an email verification software, you run the risk of sending an email or a whole entire email campaign into invalid emails, which can quickly place your domain on a blacklist or a spam radar for months or even years to come. The only way to get off the blacklists are to dispute the claim or wait months hoping the blacklist takes your domain name off the list.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>Check Your Domain On Blacklist Watches Often </b></p><p><b>The first step to avoiding a problem with your domain and the emails you are sending is to see if there already is a problem.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We recommend checking the domain blacklists every week, as a quick spam check to make sure your emails are actually hitting the inboxes you want them to hit instead of being left behind in the dreaded spam folder. Some resources you can use are </span><a href="https://www.ultratools.com/tools/spamDBLookup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultratools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mxtoolbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if your domain is on a registered blacklist and also to check your overall domain health. These resources also have the tools and tricks for disputing your domain being on a blacklist.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>Avoid Using Hyperlinks / Web Links</b></p><p><b>Hyperlinks are literally the death of your domain health when it comes to emails.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are sending a cold email campaigns and include any link to another website, you will hit spam more likely than not. These email filters are designed to protect people from spam and malicious software. How do these softwares get into your computer? Hyperlinks! </span><b>Stay away from hyperlinks like they are the plague. Even outside of cold email campaigns, hyperlinks can cause your email to end up in a spam folder of someone who actually wants to see your email.</b></p><p><b>Minimize Your Signature</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signature feature of an email can be a great asset. They allow you to look professional and provide an area to put your contact information In most cases people provide their email and or domain (website link) on their signature. This causes the same exact problems as putting a hyperlink in the body of your email. Keep your signature simple and avoid web links and hyperlinks because let&#8217;s face it, someone is not going to respond to your email because you have a great looking signature, so do not let your signature destroy your domain health and leave your domain left on a blacklist.</span></p><p><b>Avoid Buzzwords like “FREE”</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to stay away from spam filters and blacklists. In order to do so, avoid “spammy” words or phrases. Saying “FREE home estimate”, “CASH for your home in under 14 days” or anything which sounds spammy needs to stay out of your emails. The systems which filter for spam see these and flag them as, yep &#8211; you guessed it, SPAM. Rule of thumb: if it sounds like spam, if it looks like spam, if it feels like spam, no matter how great your intentions are with your email, it will hit spam.</span></p><p><b>Avoid Unnecessary Capitalization</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes with the above. Email filters look for a few specific things to mark as spam. Capitalization is one of them. Think about it this way. In a normal email what is the utility of capitalization? There really is none. This makes having an email with excess capitalization hit spam filters more times than not.</span></p><p><b>Ramp-Up Volume Of Emails Slowly</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your sending from a newly/recently created email you need to be cautious of the volume you are sending when it comes to emails. If you have a fresh email and suddenly are sending the same exact email to 1,000 emails, you will hit spam and your domain will be at risk of being blacklisted. In order to get up to those numbers it takes time and patience. Start out sending 20 emails a day for a week, then move up to 25 emails a day the following week and add 5 more a day every week until you hit the amount of emails you would like to reach. If you want to ramp up a bit faster, create different email content or create a different domain so you can scale faster and minimize the domain risk. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind your total emails sent a day from the same domain will cause your domain to have an increased risk of hitting spam. </span></p><p><b>Make Your Emails As Personal As Possible</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having emails which are “cookie cutter” emails saying the same thing to everyone receiving the email are not as effective as sending out highly personalized emails. Spam filters recognize the same email is going out to multiple people. When you have Geopoint Data Lead Lists all the information you need to craft a highly personalized email is included. This is where you can be creative and make your emails jump off the screen when compared to your competition. What do you think is more likely to get a response. Having a spammed “We buy houses any condition” email, or a email addressed to a real name, bringing up the actual address they own inside the body of the email along with other relevant, non-invasive details of their situation. I think the answer is clear.</span></p><p><b>Work Smarter, Not Harder</b></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the email campaign process easier look into a few websites specializing in email campaigns. </span><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://mailchimp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail Chimp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are great resources for your email campaign needs.</span></h3>					</div>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real estate lead list is a list of people or homes real estate professionals use for outreach to find home sellers within their target market. These lists come in a few different flavors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, there are </span><b>farmed lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>single indicator lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>stacked indicator lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p> </p><p><b>Farmed lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are typically focused on a property type, purchase price, date range and/or geographic location where the real estate professional is looking to market to each &amp; every homeowner in the broad geographic or property details. These lists are the least expensive &amp; usually include all purchase &amp; property characteristics. </span></p><p><b>Individual indicator lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are lists comprised of homeowners/properties filtered for one criteria. For example, if you had a vacant list, the list would be just that; properties which are vacant whereas stacked indicator lists, as you may have guessed, “stacks” multiple indicators, such as vacant stacked with absentee owners. </span></p><p><b>Stacked indicator Lists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow real estate investors to create lists comprised of homeowners who check off the boxes on multiple distressed or motivation criteria. Are these lists that much better? Well think about it this way… who do you think would be a more motivated seller? A homeowner who owns a vacant home or a homeowner who owns a vacant home and has a lot of available equity and low credit? I think the answer is pretty clear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we understand what a lead list is we should quickly cover what is all on a lead list. Some only come with a name or an address while others come complete with the homeowner’s name, address, contact information (cell phone numbers, landlines and email) and some go a little further and include homeowner information such as age, income, credit score etc. and property information such as mortgage amount, equity, etc.. </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><b>Do you have all the information you need on your list?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First step to learning how to use a real estate lead list is to look at the list you currently have and ask yourself a few questions:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your list have names, property addresses AND mailing addresses?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your list include contact information?</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your lead list only has the property addresses you will need to find the homeowner’s name and contact information. If it’s an investor owned home, you’re going to need the name, contact information &amp; a mailing address. If your lead list has homeowner names and addresses you will still need to find the homeowner’s contact information. If your list is “turn-key” and comes with all the information you need for outreach then you can start right away.</span></p><h3><b>Find contact information for your lists</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if you need to find missing parts of the lead list, names or contact information, you will need to have your list skip traced. If you are not familiar with skip tracing, it is a way to find missing information on a property or homeowner. Skip tracing basically takes the input data &amp; “skips” across existing national files to determine whether or not that record exists in the national database. If the record does exist, it then looks into the database to see if we have ever maintained contact information on that individual from several different regularly updated databases. The best companies will maintain cell phone, landline &amp; email addresses for both renters &amp; homeowners across the US. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different companies or people who offer skip tracing services. One thing to keep in mind when searching for skip tracing companies to use make sure to look into how they are charging you. Are they charging for “hits” or “searches”? If you do not know what a skip tracing hit rate is &#8211; read </span><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/are-you-paying-too-much-for-skip-tracing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skip Tracing: Hits and Searches &#8211; Defined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If they are charging for searches, it means you will be charged even if the contact information is not found. Typically skip tracing returns 70-90% % of the leads with contact information and the remaining comes back blank.  If they are charging you per search, you pay for leads that come back without contact information. On the other hand, if the company is charging you for hits, you only pay for the lead which comes back with contact information. A great company to look into for skip tracing is Geopoint Data.</span></p><h3><b>Outreach, outreach, outreach</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now your list is complete with contact information, there are a few different ways to outreach with your list.</span></p><p><b><i>Cold Calling</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold calling is one of the most common forms of outreach when using a lead list. Some real estate investors hire out their cold calling to call centers domestically or internationally while others do their cold calling personally. Cold calling has been around since phones were invented and is the bread and butter of all sales, including real estate. </span></p><p><b><i>Text Messaging &#8211; </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text messaging is a relatively recent marketing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">technique</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though text messaging has been around for some time, most companies have refrained from using outbound text messages as their primary means of reaching out to homeowners for the first time. The idea is that you can use relatively inexpensive touches to entice the homeowner to respond to your marketing prior to talking to them on the phone. </span></p><p><b><i>Direct Mailers</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Direct mail is a great way to outreach to the homeowners on your lead list. This would involve using the address on the lead list and either mailing your own handwritten letters (highly recommended), or mailing out materials such as pamphlets, postcards or any correspondence to the homeowner in an attempt to start the conversation about selling their home. Direct mailers can also be sent from an outsourced mailhouse so you do not need to mail to your list on your own.</span></p><p><b><i>Email Campaigns</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Email campaigns can be useful as an outreach technique. Short, simple and effective but this technique comes with a few potential problems. First off, if you email too many emails in a short period of time you can be flagged as spam and no one will see your emails. Also, if you embed links into your emails the same problem can happen. Emails can be outdated and often people have several emails they use so it can be easier to lose track of new mail. Still this method can be free and is worth the time to set-up. You can use websites like </span><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://mailshake.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mailshake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make your emailing effortless.</span></p><p><b><i>Door Knocking</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Door knocking is a great way to stir up new business. Armed with your list of home addresses you can drive or walk to these homes and try to meet the homeowners in person. You know they have a motivation from the filtering on the list you have so this is a great time to start the interpersonal communication with these homeowners to sell their homes.</span></p><p><b><i>Facebook Ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This form of outreach is not well known but can be extremely effective and even cost efficient. The way your list is utilized on facebook ads is to input the first names, last names, mailing addresses and zip codes into a custom audience list on Facebook so your facebook ad only is sent to the homeowners who are on your list. You can take this a step further by utilizing the look-a-like audience feature on Facebook to find more people who have similar interests as your email list. Facebook ads can take time to get used to and we recommend either investing in educating yourself on Facebook ads or hiring out your Facebook Ad management to get the best results.</span></p><h3><b>Why use one form of outreach when you can use them ALL?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why stop at one form of outreach? Afterall, being seen/heard from multiple sources can be a huge value ad. Think of it this way; what would be more effective? A cold call to a homeowner or a cold call to a homeowner who already received a letter in the mail, an email, saw your ad on Facebook and they got a knock on their door? This is the kind of outreach which amplifies results by creating an omnipresence focused on your list. Will this take more time, effort and money? Yes. But by going the extra mile and doing what other real estate professionals are unwilling to do, you stand apart and are more likely to close deals.</span></p><h3><b>The Money Is In The Follow-Up</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which outreach method you are using there is one simple thing which can increase your conversions dramatically. Follow up, follow up, follow up. I am sure you have heard about following-up and I am sure you are doing some sort of follow-up but the one rule in follow-up is you can never have too much follow-up. We built a list of follow-up techniques we have used to convert homeowners into homesellers both on the retail side and cash offer side over the past 16 years. If you want to learn our tried and true follow-up strategies read </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real Estate Follow-Up: Proven Methods For Converting Homeowners Into Homesellers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, if you are using cold calling as your main outreach method, take notes on the call and write a hand letter about the conversation and mail it to the homeowner. Take it a step further by sending an email or even a text right after the call or better yet while you are on the call. If the call went well, send a small gift to their door. If the call went bad, send a small gift to their door or even a postcard with information if they ever want to sell their home in the future. Did they hang up on you? Great! Call them in 3 months to see if they would like to revisit the conversation. Afterall, a lot can happen in 3 months. Are they not interested? Great! Throw them into a 6 month list to contact every 6 months to see if things have changed. Holiday coming up? Great! Use this as an opportunity to say happy holidays from your business and to stay in front of their mind so if they ever want to sell their home you are the person they think about right away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no such thing as a “bad lead,” the list you are using is filtered for a motivating indicator and no matter what, there is no excuse to give up on a lead. Timing is everything and without follow-up you are only being heard by the homeowner at one point in time, which may not be the time when they need to sell.</span></p><h3><b>Who do you know?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing to do with your list is to make sure you are asking everyone on the list if they know anyone who is looking to sell their home. On your mailers, put a finder fee section to give your lead motivation to connect you with someone they know. On a phone call, good or bad, ask them if they know anyone. It takes a few seconds and could bring you deals for simply asking the homeowners on your list a simple question.</span></p><h3><b>Where to get the best real estate lead lists?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you are armed with information on how to use a list, you may wonder where to get the best quality lists. Some real estate investors like to manually pull records from their local municipal court and get those records skip traced. This can be a cost effective method but comes with some hidden expenses. First off, again, skip tracing can cost a decent amount of money especially if you are paying for searches instead of hits. Use Geopoint Data for your skip tracing as they charge for only matches and have some of the best prices and quality in the industry. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning on ordering data online, again </span><a href="https://geopointdata.com/ref?=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopoint Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is going to be your best option. They have access to all 9 major databases which means they know the most about the homeowners and properties on your lead list. They provide name, address, cell phone numbers, landlines, emails along with homeowner and property information which will be extremely useful for your outreach. They have custom lists with no indicators, single indicator or stacked indicators so you can create any list your heart desires. Also their data is updated as often as possible so you can have confidence your lead list is accurate and fresh. </span></p>					</div>

				<p><b>Why do we really need skip tracing in the first place?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes of course we need information to contact the homeowners we find or buy on our lists </span><b>but why, if purchased, do lists not come with contact information in the first place?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a question we started thinking about when we were building Geopoint Data and the truth is, </span><b>we could not find a single reason why data providers are not providing already skip traced lists that made sense.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great a list is “cheaper” than others… if you still need to skip trace is it really?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing is the price structures for data providers are all over the place.

What this means is </span><b>Geopoint Data is a data originator and the first to have access to numerous databases of information and owns the information they sell.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other data companies are a step or two removed from originators, causing their data to be less quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having access to, and owning all, the stored data, which is refreshed as often as possible, Geopoint Data provides extensive lead lists and the skip tracing other companies only dream of. </span></p><p><b>The reason why you can leave your skip tracing companies in the dust come 2020 is you no longer need them.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you order 10,000 names on a Vacant, Absentee Owner, High-Equity stacked lead list from Geopoint Data, you get 10,000 names.These 10,000 names, again come with all the contract information you could ever need to contact them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is unlike when you order 10,000 names from other data providers and then have to send the list to a skip trace company who only return 80% of the data filled in, on a good day. By the way, most of them charge you on the 10,000 names instead of the 8,000 which come back with information… More on this when you read </span><a href="https://www.geopointdata.com/are-you-paying-too-much-for-skip-tracing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are You Paying Too Much For Skip Tracing?</span></a></p>					</div>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One simple thing may cause you to spend more on skip tracing than you need to!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing I am talking about is the </span><b>difference between paying for skip trace searches or matches.</b></p><p><b>Knowing the difference between these two and finding the right skip trace companies can save you 30% off your skip tracing expense INSTANTLY!</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dig into it!</span></p><h3><b>Skip Trace Search:</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A skip trace search is simply when a record is searched. It does not matter if a phone number comes back blank or not. When considering a company which charges per search you need to be aware of the match rate or hit rate (they are the same), this is where you lose money.</span></p><h3><b>Skip Trace Hit:</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A skip trace hit is when a record is searched and comes back with a phone number. A hit is the “successful” part of a skip trace. Some companies charge for only hits, which is a pay for what you receive model.</span></p><h3><b>Why this matters:</b></h3><p><b>If you are paying $0.20 PER SEARCH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and there is a hit rate of 70% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are only getting 70% of the records back when you are paying for 100% of the record searches.</span></p>					</div>
