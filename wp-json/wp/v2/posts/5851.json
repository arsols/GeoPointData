Also, when it comes to signing up for email subscriptions, do you always use the same one?\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast majority of people have multiple emails for multiple purposes and the emails which are not readily used may be triggered in a scraping process, some may be inactive, leading to the Achilles heel of email marketing: a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bounce <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(sending an email to an inactive email address).

The only way to get off the blacklists are to dispute the claim or wait months hoping the blacklist takes your domain name off the list.<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><b>Check Your Domain On Blacklist Watches Often\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><b>The first step to avoiding a problem with your domain and the emails you are sending is to see if there already is a problem.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We recommend checking the domain blacklists every week, as a quick spam check to make sure your emails are actually hitting the inboxes you want them to hit instead of being left behind in the dreaded spam folder. Some resources you can use are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultratools.com\/tools\/spamDBLookup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultratools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mxtoolbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mxtoolbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see if your domain is on a registered blacklist and also to check your overall domain health. These resources also have the tools and tricks for disputing your domain being on a blacklist.<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><b>Avoid Using Hyperlinks \/ Web Links<\/b><\/p><p><b>Hyperlinks are literally the death of your domain health when it comes to emails.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you are sending a cold email campaigns and include any link to another website, you will hit spam more likely than not. These email filters are designed to protect people from spam and malicious software. How do these softwares get into your computer? Hyperlinks! <\/span><b>Stay away from hyperlinks like they are the plague. Even outside of cold email campaigns, hyperlinks can cause your email to end up in a spam folder of someone who actually wants to see your email.<\/b><\/p><p><b>Minimize Your Signature<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The signature feature of an email can be a great asset. They allow you to look professional and provide an area to put your contact information In most cases people provide their email and or domain (website link) on their signature. This causes the same exact problems as putting a hyperlink in the body of your email. Keep your signature simple and avoid web links and hyperlinks because let&#8217;s face it, someone is not going to respond to your email because you have a great looking signature, so do not let your signature destroy your domain health and leave your domain left on a blacklist.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Avoid Buzzwords like \u201cFREE\u201d<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to stay away from spam filters and blacklists. In order to do so, avoid \u201cspammy\u201d words or phrases. Saying \u201cFREE home estimate\u201d, \u201cCASH for your home in under 14 days\u201d or anything which sounds spammy needs to stay out of your emails. The systems which filter for spam see these and flag them as, yep &#8211; you guessed it, SPAM. Rule of thumb: if it sounds like spam, if it looks like spam, if it feels like spam, no matter how great your intentions are with your email, it will hit spam.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Avoid Unnecessary Capitalization<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This goes with the above. Email filters look for a few specific things to mark as spam. Capitalization is one of them. Think about it this way. In a normal email what is the utility of capitalization? There really is none. This makes having an email with excess capitalization hit spam filters more times than not.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Ramp-Up Volume Of Emails Slowly<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your sending from a newly\/recently created email you need to be cautious of the volume you are sending when it comes to emails. If you have a fresh email and suddenly are sending the same exact email to 1,000 emails, you will hit spam and your domain will be at risk of being blacklisted. In order to get up to those numbers it takes time and patience. Start out sending 20 emails a day for a week, then move up to 25 emails a day the following week and add 5 more a day every week until you hit the amount of emails you would like to reach. If you want to ramp up a bit faster, create different email content or create a different domain so you can scale faster and minimize the domain risk.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind your total emails sent a day from the same domain will cause your domain to have an increased risk of hitting spam.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Make Your Emails As Personal As Possible<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having emails which are \u201ccookie cutter\u201d emails saying the same thing to everyone receiving the email are not as effective as sending out highly personalized emails. Spam filters recognize the same email is going out to multiple people. When you have Geopoint Data Lead Lists all the information you need to craft a highly personalized email is included. This is where you can be creative and make your emails jump off the screen when compared to your competition. What do you think is more likely to get a response. Having a spammed \u201cWe buy houses any condition\u201d email, or a email addressed to a real name, bringing up the actual address they own inside the body of the email along with other relevant, non-invasive details of their situation. I think the answer is clear.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Work Smarter, Not Harder<\/b><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the email campaign process easier look into a few websites specializing in email campaigns. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active Campaign<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mail Chimp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are great resources for your email campaign needs.<\/span><\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not having success with home seller lead lists?
